## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
I was about to understand the use of @media proparties in css, how flex and nav are compilimenting each other.
code snippets, see below:

```html
<nav class="main">
```
```css
@media (max-width:1000px){

}
```

### Continued development
I was not able to use grid on this project which was very complicated due to that, i was about to use margain and padding to achive the 
type oe measurement of spacing i need. i love to learn if they is a better way to do it.
